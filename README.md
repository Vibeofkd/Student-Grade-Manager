# Student-Grade-Manager
# Student Grades Manager (JS Basics)
# Student Grades Manager (JS Basics)

This is a simple Node.js project to demonstrate JavaScript fundamentals learned in Week 1 of my internship.

## Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Variables
- Using `const` to declare arrays and objects that store student data.

### 2. Data Types
- Numbers: student grades
- Strings: student names
- Arrays: list of students
- Objects: each student is an object with `name` and `grade` properties

### 3. Functions
- Arrow functions used for reusable logic.
- Example: `calculateAverage`, `getTopStudents`.

### 4. ES6 Features
- Arrow functions
- Template literals
- Array methods like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`
- Destructuring in function parameters (optional for future enhancement)

### 5. Modules (CommonJS)
- Separate files for students (`students.js`) and utility functions (`utils.js`)
- Imported using `require` and exported with `module.exports`

## How to Run

1. Make sure Node.js is installed.
2. Clone the repo.
3. Run the main script:

```bash
node index.js
